# battle_of_the_bands
This is the repo of code used to create my talk:
Battle of the Bands - Starring Tidytext and Tensorflow

All the code should run to mimic what I get in the presentation. You just need a directory called mp3 which has two folders in it: radiohead and little mix, containing all the mp3s for all their albums.

I heldout the latest two albums, A Moon Shaped Pool and LM5 to use the model on.
